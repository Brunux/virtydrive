Tests
-----

Run the test suite by doing:

```sh
$ npm test
```

Development
-----------

`denymount` wraps a native command line utility that must be built with Xcode 7.

If you make edits to the executable source make sure to build it afterwards with:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

This will build and place the compiled executable in the *bin* folder.

The command line utility can be used directly as follows:

```sh
$ ./bin/denymount diskName
```

The programme will keep running until you hit `ctrl+C` (or `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` if sent to background).
